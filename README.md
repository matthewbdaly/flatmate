Simple flat-file CMS. Drop Markdown files with front-matter in the `content` directory and they will become routes in the application.

Frontend
--------

Flatmate ships with Laravel Mix, to help you manage your front-end assets. However, it's not compulsory and you're free to replace it with whatever front-end toolchain you prefer for your own projects.
